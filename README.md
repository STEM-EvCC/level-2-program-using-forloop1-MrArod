# 📌 Task Overview
#

# 🚀 Space Mission Data Analysis

## Name: Anthony Rodriguez
## Course: STEM103

## A Python program to process space data and extract meaningful insights.

# 🎯 Objectives

## Functions include:
### ✅ Count the total number of space missions.
### ✅ Count the number of successful missions.
### ✅ Calculate the success rate of the missions.
### ✅ List all missions that were launched before the year 2000.

# 📊 Data Sample

## Data Utilized:

### mission_names = ['Apollo 11', 'Challenger', 'Curiosity Rover', 'Viking 1', 'Mars Pathfinder', 'Hubble Telescope', 'Apollo 13']
### mission_years = [1969, 1986, 2012, 1975, 1996, 1990, 1970]
### mission_success = [True, False, True, True, True, True, False]

# 📝 Implementation Steps

### Initialize counters for total missions and successful missions.

### Loop through the mission data to process each mission.

### Count successful missions by checking mission_success values.

### Identify missions before the year 2000 and store their names.

### Calculate the success rate as a percentage.

### Present the findings 


# 🔧 Technologies Used

### Python 🐍

### Loops & Conditionals

### Lists & Indexing


# 🚀 How to Run the Program

### Copy the provided data sample into a Python script (mission_analysis.py).

### Implement the analysis logic using loops and conditions.

### Run the script in your Python environment:

### python mission_analysis.py

### Review the output in your terminal.

# 📌 Notes

### Ensure that all mission data is processed correctly.

### Format the success rate to two decimal places.

### Optimize the loop logic for better performance if necessary.

# 🛠 Future Enhancements

### Expand the dataset with more missions.

### Visualize data using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### Store data in a CSV file and process it dynamically.
